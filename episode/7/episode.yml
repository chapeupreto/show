title: Parsing dates using proptest and TDD
id: zb7SD0Jco6g
intro: Testing is hard, as can be seen in the last two episodes. That's why I looked around for better alternatives and found proptest.
details: >
  Let's take a look at proptest, a library for automatically generating testcases similar to quickcheck (of Haskell fame).
  We will parse informal english dates like "4th of September 1927" using Proptest and TDD.
keywords:
  - Property testing
  - Quickcheck
  - Unit testing
  - Fuzzy testing
  - TDD
