# Creating an episode

The following notes are helpful for me when recording a new episode.  
Also, I thought it might be interesting to others, who also consider to run
their own show.  

## Getting started

* Pick an issue from the [issues
  page](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/issues) or create a new one.
* Prefix the issue title with the next show number.

## Shooting the video

* Cleanup SD card of digital camera
* Prepare lighting
* Set-up microphone
* Prepare primary and secondary camera
* Test recording and audio
* Close all unrelated apps
* Hide Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox (right-click next to address bar and remove
  tick)
* Prepare IDE settings
  - Set slightly bigger font (VS Code: `editor.fontSize": 15`)
  - ~~Enter "zen mode"~~ (doesn't show the terminal)
* Set Mac to *do not disturb mode*
* Deactivate night shift
* Start recording and get cracking!

## Shooting the intro

* Create a teaser intro that shows exactly what to expect as an outcome (show
  some code as b-roll, maybe?).

## Postproduction

1. Cut video
2. Transitions
3. Normalize sound
4. Add music and sound effects
5. Color Grading

## Before publication

* Create nice title images for the video and the website.

## Upload

When uploading the video, I first set it to "unlisted".  That gives me another
opportunity to check the quality and the editing of the final cut.  At this
phase, I also add show notes to the video description, adjust the title and add
time markers to the video description.

## Publication

* Upload the code to Github.
* Set YouTube video to "public".
* Announce publication on Twitter and Reddit.
